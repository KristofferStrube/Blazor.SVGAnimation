# Blazor.SVGAnimation
A Blazor WASM wrapper for the SVG Animation browser API.

With the wrapper we can `begin` and `end` SVG Animations from Blazor WASM without writing any JS.

The specs for the API can be found at https://svgwg.org/specs/animations/#IDL

## Demo
The sample project can be demoed at https://kristofferstrube.github.io/Blazor.SVGAnimation/

## Future Work
This is only a small part of the API and more parts of the API like subscribing to events will be added later.
